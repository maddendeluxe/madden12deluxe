FAQ

Q: What platforms does this work on?
A: This mod will specifically work on 1.7.2049 or lower builds of PCSX2 (the ones that support texture replacement). This mod cannot be played on original hardware (Stock PS2), due to the uniform, field and stadium edits that require texture replacements. This can also be played on Xbox Dev Mode or Steam Deck with additional instructions!

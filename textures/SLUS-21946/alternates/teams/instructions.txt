Some of these files I did not rename due to time. Some I did rename, but you'll need to check before using.   

I included them in case you want to rename them and replace the item. 

For example, for cleveland, if you want the elf textures, 
you'll need to rename to replace the midfield logos and the endzone logos inside of: replacements/teams/cleveland.

If you just put these into the replacements folder they will not work without first renaming them.
These are not necessary, rather enhancements if you wish to use them. 

Again, apologies for the inconvenience.

UPDATE:

New team updates thanks to johndest.  Great work, thank you for your contribution!

Indiana Nights Uniforms - Indianapolis.  Back up the replacements/teams/indianapolis helmet and home folder.  
Then delete and move the alternates/teams/indianapolis/indiana_nights folder to replacements/teams/indianapolis.

To apply the mods to the game, please use JSGME.exe to apply the mod.

If you do this before you run the game, you do not need to cycle your texture replacements.

If you are trying to apply it while running the game, make sure you cycle your texture replacements.

To cycle texture replacements, please go into your settings and switch it on or off.
You may also assign a hotkey, by going to hotkeys and assigning "Reload Texture Replacements" to a key or button.

The structure of the mod should be like this:

[name of mods folder]\[name of mod]\replacements\a-[nameofmod]
